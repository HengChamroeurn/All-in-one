Filtering a ListView in Flutter using a onChange on TextField with delay in flutter.
In this article we will see how we can filter a Listview in the onChange event of a TextField in Flutter.
Here we will use the below service Url to populate data into the ListView.

<strong><font color="purple" size="5">Create Model Class</font></strong>
 
[java]
class User {
  int id;
  String name;
  String email;

  User({this.id, this.name, this.email});

  factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return User(
      id: json["id"] as int,
      name: json["name"] as String,
      email: json["email"] as String,
    );
  }
}
[/java]

Service Class

In this class we will call the service and get the data. Then we will parse the data to get the list of users.
